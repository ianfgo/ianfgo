### Hi, I'm Ian!
I started learnig game development in middle 2020. After some projectes that I've never finished, I've published a game called Mega Vegas (this game can be found on Gamejolt). Now I have some experience on Unity and Unreal Engine (C# and C++) and .NET Fram.
Sometimes I code something, just as hobby.
