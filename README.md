### Hi, I'm Ian!
✨ I started learnig game development in middle 2020. After some projectes that I've never finished, I've published a game called Mega Vegas (this game can be found on Gamejolt). Now I have some experience on Unity and Unreal Engine (C# and C++) and .NET Framework.

👨‍💻 Sometimes I code something, just as hobby; I’m currently learning Python.

⚡ About me: I'm a Brazilian university student, I'm not studying anything directly related to programming. Unfortunately, here in Brazil, research and science are not that relevant, so I felt safer choosing another area of study.
